[ DEPRECATED ] - AppendIt
========

Grunt these days isn't recommend at all, has several security flaws and issues like COMPASS + Ruby dependecies and libraries conflicts.

Please consider using something new, this plugin has to be archived to avoid Security warnings from Github and NPM.


## About it

Based on: https://github.com/tactivos/grunt-cdn, forked and evolved to append strings as params at the end of url's and support multiples cdns.
